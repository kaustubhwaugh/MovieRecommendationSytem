# Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering techniques. Both User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering methods are used to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences and ratings. The similarity between users and items is calculated using Cosine Similarity.

## Overview

This Movie Recommendation System aims to predict movies that a user might like based on previous ratings. Collaborative Filtering is a common technique used in recommendation systems. In this implementation, two approaches are used:

1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the ratings of similar users.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies that are similar to the movies the user has already rated highly.

The system calculates similarity using **Cosine Similarity** and ranks movies based on similarity scores.
